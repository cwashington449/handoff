# Backend Project Overview - Handoff Platform

## 🎯 Project Vision

**Handoff** is a platform that connects creative visionaries ("Creators") with skilled developers ("Finishers") to transform "vibe-coded" prototypes and ideas into production-ready applications.

**The Problem**: Many creators have brilliant ideas and rough prototypes but lack the technical expertise to build scalable, production-ready applications.

**The Solution**: A marketplace that matches creators with developers, handles project scoping, manages payments, and facilitates smooth project handoffs.

## 🚀 Current State

### ✅ What's Built (Frontend)
- **Modern React/TypeScript SPA** deployed on Netlify
- **Multi-page architecture**: Home, Creators, Finishers, Pricing
- **Interactive project scoping wizard** with detailed form collection
- **Responsive design** with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components
- **Lead capture system** ready for backend integration
- **Analytics integration** for user behavior tracking

### 🔧 What's Needed (Backend)
- **Complete backend infrastructure** from scratch
- **RESTful API** to power the frontend
- **Database design** for users, projects, and business logic
- **Authentication system** with role-based access
- **Matching algorithms** between creators and finishers
- **Payment processing** with escrow functionality
- **Real-time communication** features
